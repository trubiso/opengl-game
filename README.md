# hi
so uh i'm trying to learn OpenGL using [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/)

## dependencies
* if you're a windows / visual studio user i'm deeply sorry
* otherwise: openGL, glew, glfw

## how to run
`./build.sh && ./out`

works? nice. otherwise just check the contents of `build.sh` and execute them yourself. 

## how to contribute
don't unless i ask you to because **i** want to learn OpenGL
